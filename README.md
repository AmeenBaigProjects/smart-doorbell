## What and Why
As of recent, there has been a massive surge of home surveillance devices known as "Smart Doorbells". The main appeal of these devices, is their 2-in-1 functionality of behaving as a regular doorbell while providing video surveillance of the area near your door. What makes these devices "smart" is their IoT capabilities. You can get notified about any doorbell rings or suspicious activities near your door, and access video surviellance footage through your personal devices via online services or applications. 

However, many popular smart doorbell products like the "Ring Doorbell" by Amazon are more feature rich than necessary for the average user, making them more expensive than necessary. For example, the device being able to record surveillance footage 24 hours a day, seven days a week is one such functionality of the Ring Doorbell. Although it may be a useful functionality to have, it drastically decreases the power and storage efficency of the device. Adding a simple motion detection system in the device enables it to only record when motion is detected. This results in a significant decrease in the amount of footage to capture and upload, which means a significant decrease in power and storage consumption.

I wanted to uptake a project where I designed and built such device that maximizes power and storage efficency, by implementing the basic bare-bones functionalities that would make it a Smart Doorbell.
